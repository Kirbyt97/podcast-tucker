# My T-Shaped Student Podcast Outline


## Audience
* Students who are considering Tech as their future college

## Purpose
* Inform potential new students of Tech's VT-Shaped Student idea, with emphasis placed on the 'T'
* To persuade Liberal Arts students to come to Tech.

## Structure
* My idea for this podcast is to structure it off of the informative lectures the school gives future students. 
    * I think this will be effective because of the type of information I am giving the audience. I am letting them know about Tech's motives in an informative way with personal examples.
* My main way of communicating the information will be to use myself as the main example. I feel like this is effective because I am a diverse student and I believe people respond the most to personal examples.

## Introduction

* I will begin with a quick theme song. My first cue to begin speaking will be after, at most, 10-15 seconds of the song.

As of now my theme song can be found [here](http://www.freesound.org/people/madamelabaronne/sounds/394593/)

*  Give an introduction to who I am and what this podcast is for. This may include why I am at Tech, my major, etc.
* This section will be around a minute, most likely a little bit shorter. I am aiming for 250 words in this section or less.

## What is a T-Shaped Student
* I am going to ask the audiene to think about why they chose to go to college. I will then say how most people choose to go to college to further their career and study what they love doing. I am going to have music softly playing in the background.

* After that I will let the audience know who created the idea of a T-Shaped Student. The answer to this is Tim Brown- CEO of IDEO
*  Next we will go over what exactly a T-Shaped Students is, as an over view. This will be before getting into the two different parts of the 'T' which will be found in a later section.
* I am planning on around 800 words, or 4.5 minutes alloted for this section. 

## The Parts of the 'T'
* First I will go over the verticle part
* Next will be the horizontal bar
* This section will be around 500 words or around 2.46 minutes. 
    *   This time may increase in the final draft if I decide to go more in depth here opposed to the general over view of a T-Shaped Student.

## A T-Shaped Student at Tech
* I will inform the audience of Tech's idea of a VT-Shaped student.
* I will go off of the idea that a T-Shaped Student is becoming an industry standard. This idea is not unique to VT, but Tech takes it to a new level by adding in the 'V.'
* I am going to spend most of my time talking about what I am doing to become a true T-Shaped Student
    * Discuss my dual diploma in Finance and English
    * Talk about how this will help me in a career 'unrelated' to English 
        *      Specifically how this will set me apart from other Finance majors and expand my knowledge
* This section is also going to be around 800 words, or 4.5 minutes.

## So How do You Become T-Shaped?
* As an English major how do you become T-Shaped?
    * Taking classes in other diciplines    
* Dont be afraid to use technology. It is a good tool that can intimidate those who are not familiar with it, like Englsih majors
    * Tech sounds in the background that can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/DialUp) 
*    This section will be around 250 words, or around 1 minute.  
    
    
## Closing
* Quick wrap-up of everything I have talked about
* Credits and my name again
* Repeate the same theme song for the same length 
    * Link can be found above 
* This will be about 20-30 seconds

## My Notes
* My section times are subject to change as I see fit.
    * Times will change based on what information I find most important when pulling everything together and how in depth I want the examples to go.
* I need to add more 'creative' elements to this podcast
    * As of right now it is more informative and persuasive than anything else. I like the direction the podcast seems to be going in, but I need to find a way to make it more upbeat in the final mix.
    * My current idea to make the podcast more creative is to use the angle of an English major working in a technology firm. This might mention how English majors take classes like this to learn how to make digital media and websites etc.
