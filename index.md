# My T-Shaped Student Podcast Outline

## Introduction

1. I will begin with a quick theme song. My first cue to begin speaking will be after, at most, 10 seconds of the song.

As of now my theme song can be found [here](http://www.freesound.org/people/madamelabaronne/sounds/394593/)
1. Give an introduction to who I am and what this podcast is for. This may include why I am at Tech, my major, etc.
1. This section will be around a minute, most likely a little bit shorter. I am aiming for 250 words in this section or less.
## What is a T-Shaped Student
1. First, I will let the audience know who created the idea of a T-Shaped Student. The answer to this is Tim Brown- CEO of IDEO
1. Next we will go over what exactly a T-Shaped Students is as an over view before getting into the two different parts of the 'T.'
1. We will go over how a T-Shaped Student is a popular idea and how VT is not the first to use this theory and who created it. I feel as though here is a good time for some type of sound effect or music.
## A T-Shaped Student at Tech
1. I will inform the audience of Tech's idea of a VT-Shaped student.
1. I will go off of the idea that a T-Shaped Student is becoming an industry standard, but Tech takes it to a new level by adding in the 'V.'
