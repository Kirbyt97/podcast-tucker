# My T-Shaped Student Podcast Outline

## Introduction

* I will begin with a quick theme song. My first cue to begin speaking will be after, at most, 10-15 seconds of the song.

As of now my theme song can be found [here](http://www.freesound.org/people/madamelabaronne/sounds/394593/)

*  Give an introduction to who I am and what this podcast is for. This may include why I am at Tech, my major, etc.
* This section will be around a minute, most likely a little bit shorter. I am aiming for 250 words in this section or less.

## What is a T-Shaped Student
* I am going to ask the audiene to think about why they chose to go to college. I will then say how most people choose to go to college to further their career and study what they love doing. I am going to have music softly playing in the background.

* After that I will let the audience know who created the idea of a T-Shaped Student. The answer to this is Tim Brown- CEO of IDEO
*  Next we will go over what exactly a T-Shaped Students is, as an over view. This will be before getting into the two different parts of the 'T' which will be found in a later section.
* I am planning on around 800 words, or 4.5 minutes alloted for this section. 

## The Parts of the 'T'
* First I will go over the verticle part
* Next will be the horizontal bar
* This section will be around 500 words or around 2.46 minutes. 
    *   This time may increase in the final draft if I decide to go more in depth here opposed to the general over view of a T-Shaped Student.

## A T-Shaped Student at Tech
* I will inform the audience of Tech's idea of a VT-Shaped student.
* I will go off of the idea that a T-Shaped Student is becoming an industry standard. This idea is not unique to VT, but Tech takes it to a new level by adding in the 'V.'

## So How do You Become T-Shaped?
* As an English major how do you become T-Shaped?
    * Taking classes in other diciplines    
* Dont be afraid to use technology. It is a good tool that can intimidate those who are not familiar with it, like Englsih majors
